      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Tetris is a puzzle game that was born in the mid-1980s, at a time when personal computing
        was still in its early days.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        It was created in <strong>1984 by Alexey Pajitnov</strong>, a computer engineer working at
        the <strong>Moscow Academy of Sciences</strong>. Inspired by <em>pentominoes</em>—geometric
        puzzles made of wooden blocks—Pajitnov designed a game using simple shapes made of{' '}
        <strong>four squares</strong>, called <em>tetrominoes</em>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        These shapes fall from the top of a vertical grid, and the player must{' '}
        <strong>move and rotate them</strong> to form complete lines, which disappear when
        completed. The game was first programmed on an <strong>Elektronika 60</strong> computer with
        very basic graphics, and it quickly spread informally among researchers and programmers.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The name <em>Tetris</em> comes from the Greek prefix <strong>“tetra”</strong> (four) and
        Pajitnov’s favorite sport, <strong>tennis</strong>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Without a storyline or characters, Tetris stood out for the{' '}
        <strong>purity of its rules</strong> and the <strong>depth of its gameplay</strong>. Over
        the decades, through countless adaptations, it has become one of the{' '}
        <strong>most iconic and influential video games</strong> in history.
