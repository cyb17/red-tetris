      Tetris (Russian: Тетрис)[c] is a puzzle video game created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov, a
      Soviet software engineer. In typical Tetris gameplay, falling tetromino shapes must be neatly
      sorted into a pile. Once a horizontal line of the game board is filled in, it disappears,
      granting points and preventing the pile from overflowing. Since its initial creation, this
      gameplay has been used in over 220 versions, released for over 70 platforms. Newer versions
      frequently implement additional game mechanics, some of which have become standard over time.
      As of December 2024, these versions collectively serve as the second-best-selling video game
      series with over 520 million sales, mostly on mobile devices.
